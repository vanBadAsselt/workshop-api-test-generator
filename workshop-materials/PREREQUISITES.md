### 5. AI Assistant Access

You'll need access to an AI assistant that can:
- Accept file uploads (HAR files)
- Generate code/scripts

**Recommended options:**
- **ChatGPT** - [chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com) (free tier works)
- **Claude** - [claude.ai](https://claude.ai) (free tier works)

**How to verify:**
1. Log in to your chosen AI assistant
2. Start a new conversation
3. Verify you can upload files (look for a paperclip/upload icon)

**Can't get AI access working?** No problem! During the workshop, you can team up with another attendee.

## Workshop App Setup

### Install the Superpowers Demo App

```bash
# Clone the workshop repository (if provided)
cd workshop-e2e-test-generator/superpowers

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the app
npm run dev
```

### Verify Installation

1. **Frontend:** Open http://localhost:3000
   - You should see a list of superheroes
   - Try searching for "spider"

2. **Backend:** Open http://localhost:4000/graphql
   - GraphQL Playground should load
   - You can run test queries here

If both work, you're ready! ðŸŽ‰

## Troubleshooting

### "Command not found: node"
- Node.js is not installed or not in PATH
- Restart terminal after installation
- On Windows, may need to restart computer

### "Command not found: k6"
- k6 is not installed or not in PATH
- Try closing and reopening terminal
- On Windows with Chocolatey, run as Administrator

### "Port 3000 already in use"
- Another app is using the port
- Kill the process or change the port in `frontend/vite.config.ts`

### "Port 4000 already in use"
- Backend port is taken
- Check if backend is already running in another terminal

### App doesn't show any characters
- Make sure you ran `npm install` first
- Check console for errors (F12 in browser)
- Verify `backend/data/characters.json` exists
