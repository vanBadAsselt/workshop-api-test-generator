Subject: Workshop Prep - AI-Assisted API Test Generation (90 min)

Hi everyone!

Looking forward to seeing you at the workshop! Here's what you need to know:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT WE'LL DO TOGETHER

In this 90-minute workshop, we'll use AI to generate k6 API tests from real browser traffic. You'll learn to:
• Capture API calls from your browser (HAR files)
• Use ChatGPT/Claude to generate k6 tests
• Build smart extraction scripts that make AI more effective

⚠️ IMPORTANT: This is a FOLLOW-ALONG workshop. No worries if your setup doesn't work! You can:
   • Watch and learn the concepts
   • Team up with others
   • Try it at home later with all materials provided

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

QUICK SETUP (TRY BEFORE WORKSHOP)

1. Install Node.js 18+ and npm

   Open your terminal/command prompt and check if you have it:
   → node --version
   (Should show v18.0.0 or higher)

   Don't have it? Download from: https://nodejs.org/

2. Install k6

   In your terminal, check if you have it:
   → k6 version

   Install it:
   macOS:    → brew install k6
   Windows:  → choco install k6
   Linux:    → sudo snap install k6

   Or see: https://k6.io/docs/get-started/installation/

3. Get AI Access (Free Tier Works!)

   Sign up for one of these (in your browser):
   • ChatGPT: https://chat.openai.com (free version can upload files)
   • Claude: https://claude.ai (free version can upload files)

   Verify: Can you upload a file? Look for the paperclip icon.

4. Get the Workshop Repository

   In your terminal, run:
   → git clone https://github.com/vanBadAsselt/workshop-api-test-generator
   → cd workshop-api-test-generator/superpowers

   (Or download directly from: https://github.com/vanBadAsselt/workshop-api-test-generator)

5. Run the Workshop App

   In your terminal (from the superpowers folder):
   → npm install
   → npm run dev

   Then open your browser and verify:
   • http://localhost:3000 shows superhero list ✓
   • http://localhost:4000/graphql opens GraphQL playground ✓

   If you see both, you're ready!

DIDN'T WORK? NO PROBLEM!

You can still fully participate if:
✗ Installation failed
✗ Ports are in use
✗ Don't have a laptop
✗ Node/k6 won't install

Options during the workshop:
1. Watch and learn - Follow along on the instructor's screen
2. Team up - Pair with someone who has a working setup
3. Use backup files - We'll provide pre-captured examples
4. Try at home - All materials will be available after the workshop

The goal is to learn the APPROACH and CONCEPTS, not to fight with installations!
